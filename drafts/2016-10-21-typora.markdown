title: Visual editing and Markdown with Typora
category: Tools
---

There are many Markdown editors for macOS, and most of them work in modes. You either edit text or you preview it. While this approach works fine and provides a clean writing and editing experience, sometimes I want to have both: power of Markdown and immediate visual richness of a regular document editor.

Typora is a minimalistic Markdown editor with a twist: it seamlessly switches between writing and rendering Markdown. It doesn't have a preview window or a mode switcher. It's WYSIWYGM â€”  What You See Is What You Get Markdown, if you will.

This is how it works:

### Editing

Typora supports images, lists, tables, code blocks, quotes and other regular markup elements. They are all accessible with shortcuts.

Images are rendered live as well, and the editor indicates if an image is not found.

Top right corner of the screen hides a word counter and an outline.

Creating links is very easy: just press Cmd+K and selected text becomes a link with the URL taken from the clipboard. I sometimes mix up the brackets when writing raw markdown, so this quick link feature saved me a lot of frustration.

Cmd+click opens the link in the browser, while regular click expands the markup. In general, click inside any marked element and the raw markup expands, available to edit as in any other Markdown-editor.

### Themes

Typora comes with few built-in themes, and it's incredibly easy to create new ones, since they are just regular css-files. The one in the demo video is called Newsprint. This editor looks better than many websites.

CSS-theming is a particularly useful feature for bloggers. You can make a custom theme based on your blog's design, so that you see the real end result while writing, from the first draft. It sounds like a minor thing, but I found it extremely helpful. It creates a different kind of immersion, like I'm writing literally *on my website*.

### Export

Typora exports to PDF, HTML, .docx, OpenOffice, .rtf, LaTeX, MediaWiki and even ePub. It's really easy to make a simple ebook with it.

With HTML you have two options: regular and without styles. Regular export will generate a styled HTML page using the same theme you had selected in the editor. Without styles outputs a bare bones HTML. 

Typora is currently in Beta, and there are minor hiccups here and there. It doesn't handle relatively large files (more than 50000 symbols) very well, UI starts to slow down. Windows version sometimes just dies, and since Typora doesn't have any restore capabilities, I wouldn't recommend using the Windows version extensively at the moment.

Typora Beta is [available](https://www.typora.io/) for free for Mac and Windows. It's created by Abner Lee.
